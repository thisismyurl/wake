/**
 * [CORE] Bootstrap — the single re-prefixing point for the whole theme line.
 *
 * This is the ONE place a theme's identity lives. Change the namespace and the
 * SLUG constant and the entire theme re-prefixes, because every other file
 * derives its asset handles, hooks, and i18n keys from this namespace and these
 * constants. With Colophon you rarely edit this by hand — the `colophon` CLI
 * rewrites the namespace, slug, and version here from the theme's colophon.json
 * every time it scaffolds or syncs. The constants are still the source of truth
 * at runtime; the CLI just keeps them honest.
 *
 * Why a namespace instead of a `mytheme_`-style function prefix: callbacks
 * register as `__NAMESPACE__ . '\\fn'`, so renaming the namespace re-points
 * every hook at once, with no second list of callback strings to keep in sync.
 * WordPress.org requires a unique prefix per theme; this concentrates that whole
 * requirement into the one line below.
 *
 * NOTE — the one place "tidy" is a bug: the text DOMAIN in __()/_e()/esc_html__()
 * stays a string LITERAL ('colophon'), never the SLUG constant. `wp i18n
 * make-pot` reads source statically and only recognises a literal as the domain
 * argument; hand it a constant and it extracts nothing and ships an
 * untranslatable theme. The CLI rewrites the literal too, so it survives a
 * re-skin. See ARCHITECTURE.md §4.
