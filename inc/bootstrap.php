/**
 * [CORE] Bootstrap — the single re-prefixing point for the whole theme line.
 *
 * This is the ONE place a theme's identity lives. Change the `wake_` function
 * prefix and the WAKE_* constants and the entire theme re-prefixes, because
 * every other file derives its asset handles, hooks, and i18n keys from them. With
 * Colophon you rarely edit this by hand; the prefix, slug and version here are set when the theme is scaffolded or
 * syncs. The constants are still the source of truth at runtime; the CLI just keeps
 * them honest.
 *
 * Why a `wake_` function prefix and not a namespace (reversed 2026-07-20):
 * this line originally read `namespace Wake;`, on the reasoning that callbacks
 * register as `__NAMESPACE__ . '\\fn'` and so renaming one line re-points every
 * hook at once. The WordPress.org Theme Review Team rejected that on ticket
 * #280625, which closed this theme as not-approved: a namespace is accepted only at
 * the CLASS level, because a WordPress site loads a large number of vendor
 * functions into the global scope and a bare `function setup()` inside a namespace
 * still reads as unprefixed. Every function, constant, and class defined in the
 * global scope must carry a unique per-theme prefix, no abbreviations. The CLI now
 * rewrites `wake_` → `<slug>_`, `WAKE_` → `<SLUG>_`, and `Wake_` →
 * `<Slug>_`, so the one-place-to-re-prefix property survives the change.
 *
 * NOTE — the one place "tidy" is a bug: the text DOMAIN in __()/_e()/esc_html__()
 * stays a string LITERAL ('wake'), never the WAKE_SLUG constant. `wp i18n
 * make-pot` reads source statically and only recognises a literal as the domain
 * argument; hand it a constant and it extracts nothing and ships an
 * untranslatable theme. The CLI rewrites the literal too, so it survives a
 * re-skin.
