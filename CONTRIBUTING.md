## Non-Negotiable Standards

### 1. WCAG 2.2 AA
Every template, pattern, and style must meet WCAG 2.2 AA. If it is not accessible, it is not complete.

### 2. Zero JavaScript
The Colophon theme collection ships with zero runtime JavaScript. Do not add JS.

### 3. Self-Hosted Fonts Only
No Google Fonts, no external font CDNs. All fonts must be bundled under `assets/fonts/` under an OFL or equivalent license.

### 4. Helpful Neighbor Tone
No manipulative copy. No nagware. No dark patterns.

### 5. Safe by Default
No hidden external calls, no tracking, no opaque defaults.
