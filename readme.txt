A deliberately plain, technically exacting full-site-editing starter core, built to be copied and re-skinned rather than inherited.

== Description ==

Colophon is the shared core behind a small line of free WordPress themes. It is
a starter, not a finished design: a clean set of bones — the accessibility
scaffolding, the Core Web Vitals discipline, a six-layer CSS cascade contract, a
one-file re-prefixing point, and a set of thin, standards-correct templates — on
which a fully designed theme is built by re-skinning, not by inheriting.

There is no parent/child coupling. A theme built on Colophon is copied from it
and ships as a self-contained, standalone theme with no runtime dependency on
Colophon at all. The shared core stays in sync during development through a small
command-line tool; the shipped theme is just a normal WordPress theme.

The default skin is intentionally restrained: system fonts (no bundled font
files, no third-party calls), a grayscale palette with one calm accent, and a
reading-first layout. It is meant to be replaced.

* Full-site editing — every template and template part editable in the Site Editor.
* Zero front-end JavaScript, zero plugin dependencies.
* WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility scaffolding — skip link, visible focus, sensible heading order, `prefers-reduced-motion` honoured globally.
* Core Web Vitals discipline — `font-display: swap`, no render-blocking third-party requests.
* Six-layer CSS cascade (`reset, base, layout, components, blocks, utilities`).
* A semantic-token contract (`--cl-*`) that lets the portable core stay colour-agnostic while each skin binds the tokens to its own palette.
* Translation-ready — every user-facing string is internationalised.
* RTL-ready through CSS logical properties.
